/**
 * A TimeStepper that takes time steppers as inputs and computes the minimum time step size among
 * all time steppers as output. If any time sequence stepper(s) is supplied for input, CompositionDT
 * will compare the computed minimum time step size with the one needs to hit the time point, then
 * select the smaller value as output. An optional parameter lower_bound is provided
 * to set a lower bound for the computed time step size.
 *
 * The composition rules are listed with priority rank:
 * 1. The time points from time sequence stepper(s) must be hit;
 * 2. The time step size can not go below the lower_bound;
 * 3. Take the minimum value of all input time steppers.
